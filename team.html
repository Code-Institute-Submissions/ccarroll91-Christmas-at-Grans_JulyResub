                        <p>Christmas at Gran's was written by Michael Brennan at the age of 10, and adapted into this digital story by Conor Carroll. It is with deep regret that Conor discovered that Bonzo 
                        did not, in fact, exist, and was a figment of Brennan's imagination for the sake of the poem. As Michael's brother Tom put it, he took "a bit of creative licence there". We hope that 
                        you love him all the same.
