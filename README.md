# Christmas at Gran's

"Christmas at Gran's" is a poem written by Michael Brennan at the age of ten. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, 
Brennan was forced to return to England from his home of many years, Dublin. It is here that the Author of this 
site, Conor Carroll, resides. Carroll, on the side, is an artist and illustrator, and decided to create this site 
as a homage to his friend. 

The pair are aligned in the belief that there can never too many stories in the world, and so pushing this poem 
to the greater reaches of the internet is not just a present for a friend, but a light-hearted form of digital story 
telling. The resulting piece is aimed to be age appropriate, approachable, and enjoyable, while being completely accessible 
to all audiences.

## UX

### Scope

The site is made to be an online story aimed at children. The site is made to host an image carousel with optional audio.

#### User stories

##### Visitor goals

1. As a visitor to the site, I want to read a poem about a traditional family Christmas.
2. As a visitor to the site, I want full accessibility and array of methods to enjoy the story.
3. As a visitor to the site, I want to be able to contact the creators of the story and the site for a variety of reasons.

##### Owner goals

4. As the owner of the site, I want to tell a fun story on behalf of a close friend - the world can never have too many stories.
5. As the owner of the site, I want to promote my work, both in visual storytelling and in site development.

### Structure

The site has been put together using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Supports, such as Bootstrap and jQuery, were installed, and used where necessary, or for future developments of the project. 
Navigation through the site can be easily done using the nar-bar button in the header, but an additonal "about" feature located in the footer.

### Skeleton

Section 1 - Home page - Header with title and navigation on top, an introduction to the story and how to use the features, 
a carousel of images to tell the story, a brief team section, and a footer loate at the bottom to frame the page, with a brief "about" section.

Section 2 - Contact page - With the same header and footer, the page is filled with a contact form, requiring the user input their name, email and 
message to the team, before clicking on a styled "submit" button.

### Surface

**Colours**

The colours used were intentional, to reflect the snowy, cold conditions that many associate with the holiday season. A light blue for the background and 
a darker blue for the header and footer create a contrast that remains soft to look at, while generating feelings of winter. 

Colours used on the site are (without titles):

- #304255 : A greyish dark blue used for the header and footer, as well as on the buttons.
- #f0f8ff : A lighter blue used for the background colour of the site. It's lightness creates a suitable contrast for black font to appear.
- #d4d7da : An off-white/blue that is used for the header/footer/button fonts. It creates a softness while still being legible.
- #253241 : A darker for mof the header, used as a hover for the dropdown menu and the intro font.

**Icons** used are from fontawesome.com. They are seen on the fullscreen button and the submit button.

**Images** used are all drawn by the author of the site, Conor Carroll. They are in png format, and have been condensed. 

**Audio** used comes from a text-to-speech app "#"

**Fonts** :

- **Mountains of Christmas" was used for the header, footer, subheading and buttons, as well as mentions of the title "Christmas at Gran's".
- **Inter** was used for all other areas
